# Diabetes Classification Regression
This project focuses on classifying the diabetes outcome and predicting the value of diabetes pedigree function. The dataset includes information like the number of pregnancies, blood glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, age, and the diabetes outcome 

# Dataset
In this project we will perform classification and regression using diabetes data which can be accessed through the following file: [diabetes.csv](https://github.com/pramudyalyza/Diabetes-Classification-Regression/blob/main/diabetes.csv). Please download the dataset from the provided link before running the code.

# Files
* **diabetes.csv:** A csv file contains all the data we need to do this project
* **Diabetes Prediction - Code.ipynb:** A Python notebook contains all the code to do the classification & regression
* **Diabetes Prediction - Slides.pdf:** This PDF file contains all the explanation of how to do this project
